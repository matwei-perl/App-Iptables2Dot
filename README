NAME
    iptables2dot - turn iptables-save output into graphs for GraphViz

SYNOPSIS
     iptables2dot [options] [iptables-save-output-file]

OPTIONS
    --help  Print a brief help message and exit.

    --manual
            Print the manual page and exit.

    --add-optdef optdef
            Provide an option definition for an iptables option that is
            unknown to the rule parser from App::Iptables2Dot.

            If the program dies with the message *unknown argument in rule:
            --unknown-opt arg*, you could run it like this:

             iptables2dot --add-optdef unknown-opt=s iptables-save-output

            This may allow you to finish your analysis of
            iptables-save-output-file without having to modify the module
            source in *lib/App/Iptables2Dot.pm*. Look at App::Iptables2Dot
            for further information.

    --edgelabel
            Provide labels at the edge showing the input or output device
            for a jump rule.

    --omittargets targetlist
            Omit some jump targets in the *dot* graph when given together
            with "--showrules". Multiple targets are separated by comma.

    --showrules/--noshowrules
            Show/don't show the rules for the chains. Default is
            "--showrules".

    --showunusednodes/--noshowunusednodes
            Show/don't show chains without jumps to other chains. Default is
            "--noshowunusednodes".

    --tables tablelist
            Only print the tables given in *tablelist*. The tables in
            *tablelist* are separated by comma.

            Possible tables are "nat", "raw", "mangle" and "filter".
            Defaults to table "filter".

    -- se-numbered-nodes

            With a true value the nodes in the dot file will be named node0,
            node1, .. noden and provided with a label showing their name froms
            iptables-save output.

            This option can help if the filter rules contain chains with a dash
            in their name, which is not allowed as input for dot.

DESCRIPTION
    This program takes the output from the command "iptables-save" on Linux
    and turns into input suitable for the "dot" program from GraphViz.

    It takes the output form "iptables-save" either from standard input
    (STDIN) or from a text file whose name was given on the command line.

    It writes the graph description for the "dot" program to standard output
    (STDOUT).

    The main purpose of this program is to get an overview of a given
    iptables configuration and understand the possible jumps between
    different chains in the tables. I usually make a printout of the graph
    for the different tables and have it at hand when studying the rules.

    The typical workflow is:

     $ sudo iptables-save \
       | iptables2dot -noshowrules -table filter \
       > iptables-filter-overview.dot
     $ dot -Tpdf iptables-filter-overview.dot -o iptables-filter-overview.pdf

    Although it is possible to make a detailed graph of an iptables
    configuration containing all rules, I wouldn't recommend this in most
    cases.

    In those configurations, where you would need the graph to comprehend
    the rules, the resulting graph would be a mess.

    When the graph looks neat and is legible on A4 paper, you would probably
    understand the configuration without it. But it could be handy to
    explain the rules to someone else, following them with a pencil or your
    finger.

    You would do this to get a detailed graph:

     $ sudo iptables-save \
       | iptables2dot -edgelabel -table filter \
       > iptables-filter.dot
     $ dot -Tpdf iptables-filter.dot -o iptables-filter.pdf

DIAGNOSTICS
    "unknown argument in rule: %s"
        The program will die with this message showing the rule for
        *iptables-save* that contained an unknown option.

        Since the rules are parsed by "GetOptionsFromString()" from module
        *Getopt::Long*, you may workaround this by adding the unknown option
        to the array @optdefs at the top of Apt/Iptables2Dot.pm. After that
        please file a bug at <https://rt.cpan.org/> or send me a notice at
        mamawe@cpan.org to have it fixed in one of the next releases of this
        distribution.

        Alternatively you may want to use the program like this

         iptables2dot --add-optdef unknown-opt=s ...

        if the program dies with message *unknown argument in rule:
        --unknown-opt arg ...* and you don't want to touch the library file
        *Apt/Iptables2Dot.pm*.
