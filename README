    graph-iptables - turn iptables-save output into graphs for GraphViz

SYNOPSIS
     iptables2dot [options] [iptables-save-output-file]

OPTIONS
    -help   Print a brief help message and exit.

    -manual Print the manual page and exit.

    -edgelabel
            Provide labels at the edge showing the input or output device
            for a jump rule.

    -noshowrules
            Don't show the rules for the chains. Instead show only the
            possible jumps from chain to chain.

    -tables tablelist
            Only print the tables given in *tablelist*. The tables in
            *tablelist* are separated by comma.

            Possible tables are "nat", "raw", "mangle" and "filter".
            Defaults to table "filter".

DESCRIPTION
    This program takes the output from the command "iptables-save" on Linux
    and turns into input suitable for the "dot" program from GraphViz.

    It takes the output form "iptables-save" either from standard input
    (STDIN) or from a text file whose name was given on the command line.

    It writes the graph description for the "dot" program to standard output
    (STDOUT).

    There are two use cases for this program. The first is to get an
    overview of a given iptables configuration and understand the possible
    jumps between different chains in the tables. The second is to make a
    detailed analysis of an iptables configuration using the detailed
    graphical representation.

    The typical workflow for the first use case would be:

     $ sudo iptables-save \
       | iptables2dot -noshowrules -table filter \
       > iptables-filter-overview.dot
     $ dot -Tpdf iptables-filter-overview.dot -o iptables-filter-overview.pdf

    For the second use case you would do this:

     $ sudo iptables-save \
       | iptables2dot -edgelabel -table filter \
       > iptables-filter.dot
     $ dot -Tpdf iptables-filter.dot -o iptables-filter.pdf
