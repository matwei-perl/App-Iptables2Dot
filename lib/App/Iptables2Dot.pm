=head1 NAME

App::Iptables2Dot - turn iptables-save output into graphs for GraphViz


=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::Iptables2Dot version 0.1.0


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::Iptables2Dot;

    App::IpTables2Dot::add_optdef('unknown-opt=s');

    my $i2d = new App::Iptables2Dot()
    
    $i2d->read_iptables(\*STDIN);
    $i2d->read_iptables_file($fname);

    print $i2d->dot_graph( {showrules => 1} , @tables);

=for author to fill in:
    Brief code example(s) here showing commonest usage(s).
    This section will be as far as many users bother reading
    so make it as educational and exeplary as possible.
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for author to fill in:
    Write a full description of the module and its features here.
    Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new()

Create a new App::Iptables2Dot object.

=head2 dot_graph( $opt, @tables )

Returns a description suitable for the I<dot> program of the iptables rules
from the given tables according to the options given in $opt.

Arguments:

=over

=item $opt

A hash reference with the following options:

=over

=item edgelabel => 0,

With a true value edges may be labeled with the interface that determines the
matching rule for the jump.

=item omittargets => '',

The given targets will be suppressed in the I<dot> graph. This only works
together with option I<showrules>.

Multiple targets are separated with comma (C<,>). For instance:

 { omittargets => 'SNAT,DNAT',
   showrules   => 1,
 }

=item showrules => 0,

With a true value all rules of a chain will be added to the node representing
that chain.

=item showunusednodes => 0,

Usually chains with no jumps to other chains or targets will not be shown.
With a true value these chains show up in the graph.

=back

=item @tables

An array containing the table names we are interested in. Namely C<filter>,
C<mangle>, C<nat> and C<raw>.

=back

=head2 read_iptables( $input )

Reads the output from iptables-save from the given input stream.

=head2 read_iptables_file( $fname )

Reads the saved output from iptables-save from the file with name
C<$fname>.

=head2 App::Iptables2Dot::add_optdef( $optdef )

This function is not bound to an App::Iptables2Dot object.

You usually want to use this to extend the rule parser with the given option
definition if you find that the iptables-save output you analyze uses an
option that the rule parser didn't know.

=for author to fill in:
    Write a separate section listing the public components of the modules
    interface. These normally consist of either subroutines that may be
    exported, or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the
    classes provided by the module.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< can't open file '%s' to read iptables-save output >>

Method read_iptables_file will die with this message if it could not open
the file given with C<$fname>.

=item C<< unknown argument in rule: %s >>

The rule parser will die with this message showing the rule for
I<iptables-save> that contained an unknown parameter.

Since the rules are parsed by C<GetOptionsFromString()> from module
I<Getopt::Long>, you may workaround this by adding the unknown option to the
array C<@optdefs> at the top of F<Apt/Iptables2Dot.pm>. After that please file
a bug at L<https://rt.cpan.org/> or send me a notice at L<mamawe@cpan.org>
to have it fixed in one of the next releases of this distribution.

Alternatively you may want to use I<App::Iptables2Dot::add_optdef()> like this

 App::Iptables2Dot::add_optdef('unknown-opt=s');

if the rule parser dies with message
I<unknown argument in rule: --unknown-opt arg ...> and you don't want to touch
the library file I<Apt/Iptables2Dot.pm>.

=item C<< unrecognized line: %s >>

The function that read in the output from I<iptables-save> found a line that
it could not interpret and died in grief and despair. If you think the line
ist valid output from I<iptables-save>, please file a bug at
L<https://rt.cpan.org/> or send me a notice at L<mamawe@cpan.org>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
    A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
    module, including the names and locations of any configuration
    files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
    that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
    configuration language used.
  
App::Iptables2Dot requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

=over

=item Getopt::Long

=item Pod::Usage

=back


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-app-iptables2dot@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
